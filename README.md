# Advent of Code Python Template for Copier

This template creates scaffolding for one day of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). It includes tests and can download your personal input data if you have [`advent-of-code-data`](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/) installed.

## Quick Start

The first time you use this template you should make sure that you have [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) installed and optionally `advent-of-code-data` as well. You can install these with pipx and pip:

```console
$ pipx install copier
$ python -m pip install advent-of-code-data
```

Once you have Copier on your system, you can create Advent of Code solution templates as follows:

```console
$ copier https://github.com/gahjelle/template-aoc-python advent_of_code
```

This will ask you about which **year** and **day** you want to template. The files are copied into a subdirectory of the `advent_of_code` directory on your computer.
